                Description: Vetro Corsa is a rendition of the classic Marble Madness arcade game made at CMU's NHSGA Lightning Round in 2024.
                It is a singleplayer and local multiplayer game, where you can roll and dash through beautiful biomes as a high-tech ball as you race to the goal.

            <p>
                Vetro Corsa was made during the Lightning Game Round (2 weeks) at the CMU Game Academy in 2024. 
                It was a complete process from prototyping, pitching, art direction, to programming and presenting our final product.
                However, I do note that we were tasked with reimagining the arcade game, Marble Madness. 
                We went through many iterations of what a completely new game would look like, while not losing the arcade feeling and the intense speedrun gameplay. 
                To fit into the time crunch, we focused on using shader graph for abstract decorations, while using post processing to achieve feelings of being the arctic or the ocean. 
                Programming for a game with many complex mechanics such as pvp, respawning, dashing, teleporting, etc., was challening but enjoyable.
                In some cases I had to rewrite code completely, but it was necessary to avoid sunk cost.
                Within the 2 weeks, we had to also consider the user experience, and consider what was most enjoyable to users such as 2 player mode, while removing redundant mechanics. 
                Overall, it was a wonderful experience working in such a motivating environment while learning how to make a fun game under a theme.
