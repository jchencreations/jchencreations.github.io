                Description: AUGUST:

                A personal project made as a test on how video games could help seniors with short term memory loss and memory training.
                The theme of the game is about how a fantastical robot could help a patient by removing clouded memory in their brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally did this project to fully explore how video games were made, so I intended to go through the entire pipeline.
                I learned a lot about 3D modeling, how to save past plays using file saving, and how to create a cohesive game experience. 
                The game did not end up fully polished, and I still have a lot to learn.
