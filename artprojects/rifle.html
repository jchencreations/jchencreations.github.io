            <h1>Wheelock Rifle Study from the Philadelphia Museum of Art</h1>

            <p>
                Medium: Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance Painter
            </p>

                Description: This was our very first project for 3D modeling class.
                We were tasked with studying an object from the Philly Museum of Art, texturing it, and displaying it through a turntable animation.
                I experience working with Maya and Substance Painter for the first time.
                It was very challenging to work with the weird spiral shape of the gun, and the overall topology, but it was also intriguing to see how woodworkers would have done it.
                I've attached my reference images at the bottom.
