            <h1>Late Night Drive in Philly</h1>

            <p>
                Medium: Autodesk Maya and Davinci Resolve
            </p>

                Description: This was my final project for my 3D modeling class.
                The goal was to create a short animation, and I chose to do a sort of stylistic way of showing off a car model and the city of Philadelphia.
                I designed the car myself based off of various Aston Martin and Mclaren builds.
                I learned how to import STL files of the city's geography and buildings and convert that into something more efficient for animation.
                I also reworked Maya's Toon Shader to create a stylized cartoon effect on the car and the environment to create the ramp shading.
                I then used Davinci Resolve to create the halftones and the speed lines.
                I also did a bit of audio engineering to create a more realistic sound experience.
